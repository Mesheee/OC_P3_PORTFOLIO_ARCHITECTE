This project was made as part of my __Web Development__ studies at __OpenClassrooms__. It is therefore an exercise with a scenario : as a __front-end developer__, I joined a team working on the design of an interior designer's portfolio site.

My main missions on this project were:
* The presentation page of the architect's work
* The administrator site login page
* The modal for deleting and uploading new media

This project uses __Html, Css and Javascript__ languages.

Skills assessed: 
* Retrieve user data in JavaScript via forms
* Manipulate DOM elements with JavaScript
* Manage user events with JavaScript
